# QR-Code-Generator

Python based QR code generator. 

Main libraries: pyqr and customtkinter.

The app version was too large to upload, I've uploaded the script and all necessary resources.

To convert the script to an executable, install pyinstaller using "pip install pyinstaller" and use the following command in the terminal or CMD:

pyinstaller --onefile --icon=myIcon.ico --noconsole QR_Code_Generator_GUI.py
