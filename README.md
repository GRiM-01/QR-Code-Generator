# QR-Code-Generator

Python based QR code generator. 

Main libraries: pyqrcode. Pillow and customtkinter.


The **v2 Edition** of the QR code generator now has a **more appealing UI/UX**. Additionally PNG QR codes are saved with **rounded corners** and lastly QR codes can now be **saved as svg** files


The app version was too large to upload normally so Ihave loaded it as a Release in a zip folder. 
The app has a help button that will explain general procedure if necessary however, it is a rather simple and intuitive process.
